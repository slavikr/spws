Hello and welcome to my very first blog, ever !

I've always been passionate about writing, that is one of the main reasons i started this blog. It keeps my brain working. I know i might not be good at it, but it takes time, practice and patience. Since this is a personal blog, i plan on sharing my interests, hobbies, and stories as well.

This web page was created, so that i can show what i've made and learned, during my learning process.
I am hoping to grow from this blog to a more knowledgeable person in the sphere of web development.

I started simply by editing themes for popular content managment systems like Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal and other, not so popular ones. But that was not enough, so i started learning the basics. All of that experience was new to me, scary but exciting. The feeling that i get from completing something is the thing that drives me forward. So i'll keep working persistently towards improving, polishing what i've learned, challenging myself with new things.

At the moment, my primary aim is to better understand how to work with technologies like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/). These 3 will help provide better website stability and performance. Right after that, i plan to dive in to [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com) and UX for a better user experiance.

I guess that will be all for my first blog post. Thank you for reading and i'll catch you in the next one.
